NAME
    Lingua::PT::Gender - Decides if a Portuguese proper name is male or
    female

SYNOPSIS
      use Lingua::PT::Gender qw/ptbr_gender/;
  
      $result = ptbr_gender("Marco Carnut");
      # $result now holds 1 meaning 'male'
  
      $result = ptbr_gender("Ana Paula");
      # $result = now holds 0 meaning 'female'

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a routine to decide whether a Portuguese name is
    male or female. The algorithm examines a table of suffixes to determine
    this.

    The table was computed using a recursive space subdivision algorithm
    operating on a database of about 60,000 proper names.

    Typical accuracy is greater than 99%. This makes it useful to find
    enrollment errors in databases.

  ptbr_gender
    This is the only function in this module. It returns 0 for female or 1
    for male. Comparisons are case insensitive. It expects non-accented
    letters; it is your responsibility to strip them beforehand. The routine
    considers only the first name (word) on the string; all others are
    ignored.

    A simple filter that gets names from the standard input and prefixes
    them with M or F accordingly:

       #!/usr/bin/perl
   
       use Lingua::PT::Gender qw/ptbr_gender/; 

       while (<>)
       {
           print ptbr_gender($_) ? "M" : "F";
           print " $_";
       }
